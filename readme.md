# Spherical Game of Life

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life on a spherical surface using the HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization) grid system. This project explores emergent behavior in cellular automata when constrained to a spherical topology.

## Background

### Why Spherical?

Most implementations of Conway's Game of Life operate on a flat grid with either bounded edges or torus topology (wrapping around edges). While the torus topology eliminates edge effects, it introduces its own geometric artifacts due to the toroidal surface's fundamental shape. A sphere provides a natural boundary-free surface for cellular automata to evolve, allowing for truly continuous patterns without edge artifacts.

### Why HEALPix?

The HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization) framework, originally developed for cosmic microwave background radiation analysis, provides an elegant solution to the sphere discretization problem. HEALPix offers several crucial properties that make it ideal for spherical Game of Life:

1. **Equal Areas**: All pixels have the same surface area, ensuring uniform cellular distribution
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: The grid can be refined to different resolutions while maintaining its fundamental properties
3. **Uniform Connectivity**: Each pixel has exactly 8 neighbors (except for a small number of pixels that have 7 or 9), closely matching Conway's original 8-neighbor rule
4. **No Singularities**: Unlike latitude-longitude grids, HEALPix avoids polar singularities

### Emergent Behavior

This implementation allows for the exploration of emergent patterns in cellular automata when constrained to a spherical surface. Some interesting phenomena to observe:

- Pattern propagation across the sphere's curvature
- Formation and interaction of stable structures on curved space
- Global population dynamics in a finite but boundaryless system
- Emergence of rotating patterns that leverage the sphere's symmetries

## Features
